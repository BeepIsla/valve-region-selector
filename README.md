# Region Selector

Allows you to select what servers to connect to in the following games: `Team Fortress 2` and `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive`

In the future I will maybe add support for more games if requested.

# Installation

1. Download the latest version from the ["Releases" section](/releases);
2. Install the program
3. It should now automatically open, if not run the created `Valve Region Selector.exe` on your desktop
