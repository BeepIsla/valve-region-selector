# Region Selector

Allows you to select what servers to connect to in the following games: `Team Fortress 2` and `Counter-Strike: Global Offensive`

In the future I will maybe add support for more games if requested.

# Installation

1. Download the latest version from the `Releases` section
2. Install the program
3. It should now automatically open, if not run the created `Valve Region Selector.exe` on your desktop

# Questions

- How do I update?
- - Uninstall the old version, go to Github and download the new version.

- What do the checkboxes mean? Can I completely disable a region?
- - You cannot disable off a region. The checkboxes simply mean whether or not the program will modify the ping. If a region is red it will use your real ping. If a region is green it will use your selected ping. If you don't want to connect to a specific region I recommend simply setting it to 500.

- Can I close the program after enabling it?
- - No. The program is keeping Steam running, if you close it Steam will close too.

- Do I have to restart every time I change the ping settings?
- - No. You can change your ping settings whenever you want. Some games may update instantly, some may not. Team Fortress 2 for example only updates pings every ~3 minutes so you may have to wait before your changes apply.
